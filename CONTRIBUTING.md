## Use Go-Streamdeck From Source

To use the `master` branch, another branch, or a branch in your own fork, you can use the `replace` syntax in your `go.mod` file. For more information and an example try this [excellent blog post from Pam Selle](https://thewebivore.com/using-replace-in-go-mod-to-point-to-your-local-module/).

## Share Issues, Bugs and Feature Requests

Go ahead and open an issue, choosing whether you are making a bug report, or a feature request. If it's both, or neither, just pick one! The only difference is the template you are prompted to complete. It's fine to ask questions and support queries by opening an issue on this repository too.

## Submit a Patch or Pull Request

You will need to fork the repository to offer patches. Please make sure your master branch is up to date, then start a new branch, named for the feature/bugfix it contains.

For large changes, please open an issue for discussion so that we know we are not duplicating work or working on a feature that won't be accepted at the end of the process.

## Try the Examples

The `examples/` directory has a series of examples that may be useful in your own applications. Try these out to see the various features in action.

Please open an issue to update us for which operating systems and StreamDeck combinations are working well for you!

## Usage in Other Projects

You are very welcome to use this project within the terms of the license. We would love to have you in our showcase, please open a pull request to update the `REAMDME.md` file with a link to your project.
